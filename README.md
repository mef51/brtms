An online tournament management system made for Ottawa`s Battle Royale LAN Party.

* Folder 'a': All the scripts that process AJAX requests.
* Folder 'l': Bunch of 'library' scripts, useless by themselves.
* Folder 't': Hidden administrative pages.
* Folder 'style': contains the bottom*.inc/top*.inc theme files, CSS files, theme images, and JavaScript files.
* The two script_raw.p?.js files do most of the dynamic client-side stuff (p1 for tournaments.php, p2 for everything else).  P1 is not the prettiest...
* The root contains all the main PHP files for pages.
